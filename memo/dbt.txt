dbt by default concatenate default schema & custom schema.
If default schema is "demo" and custom schema is "staging", then a table is created in "demo_staging"
Which looks like: {{ default_schema }}_{{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
See: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas
  
  schemas can be set in 3 locations which is:
  1. profiles.yml
  2. dbt_project.yml
  3. queries
Go deeper, more priority and overwriting values for parameters happens usually, however it is not the case for schema
